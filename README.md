## Inspiration
Our project for Muhammadiyah was inspired by the organization's longstanding commitment to social cohesion, community support, and inclusivity. Living in a diverse society, we recognized the importance of fostering responsibility through actionable initiatives. We aimed to develop a solution that strengthens community bonds and promotes shared responsibility.

#### For Residents:
- A streamlined dashboard to easily track voucher balances, transaction history, and available products.
- The ability to add their own personal touch with customisable wallpapers and profile settings.
- The ability to request items or place preorders for out-of-stock products.
- A secure login process with optional password reset via mobile.

#### For Admins:
- User management features, including adding, suspending, and resetting passwords.
- The ability to approve or reject voucher tasks and product requests, with detailed tracking of actions.
- Tools for managing inventory, along with audit logs for transparency and accountability.
- Reporting capabilities to generate insights such as weekly requests and inventory summaries.

This system is designed to enhance efficiency, provide transparency, and deliver a seamless experience for all users.
